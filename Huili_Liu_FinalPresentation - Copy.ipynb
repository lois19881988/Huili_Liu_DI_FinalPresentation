    "One significant element of movie poster design is the brightness of a poster. Different brightness can lead to different emotional reactions among audiences. Therefore, for some movie genres, there are certain stereotypical brightness patterns. For example, the posters for horror movies are often dark (see the new horror movie “IT”) and use black as the dominant color. With this type of design, audiences can feel the depressing and intense atmosphere just by looking at the poster. While comedies on the other hand are much lighter in their poster design (see the classic comedy “Home Alone”). A design with bright colors puts people at ease."

    "One cannot ascribe the success of a movie solely to the design of the poster, but for a multi-billion dollar industry where a small improvement could lead to a great return for investors, there is great merit in investigating the relationship between the brightness of a poster and the success of the movie. Specifically, when a poster’s brightness deviates from other movies with the same genre, would it be a positive or negative sign for a movie? \n",
