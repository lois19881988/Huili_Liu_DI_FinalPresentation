    "One significant element of movie poster design is the brightness of a poster. Different brightness can lead to different emotional reactions among audiences. Therefore, for some movie genres, there are certain stereotypical brightness patterns. For example, the posters for horror movies are often dark (see the new horror movie “IT”) and use black as the dominant color. With this type of design, audiences can feel the depressing and intense atmosphere just by looking at the poster. While comedies, on the other hand, are much lighter in their poster designs (see the classic comedy “Home Alone”). A design with bright colors puts audiences at ease."
